## My Approach

I've used a Next.js 13 project in combination with Tailwind as my CSS framework and ShadCN Components for various components.

I have intentionally not made it pixel-perfect as I wanted to focus on the functionality and responsiveness of the app.

I have used Next Actions for communcation with the server.

I have also use Zustand as a Redux alternative for state management (Active Badge).
